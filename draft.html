        <h1>How to get started with a dataset</h1>
          <h3>Build a mental model of your data</h3>
        <p>Compute all the basic stats.</p>
        <p>Write out down all obvious artifacts about your data to keep in mind.</p>
        <p>Spend some serious time just looking at it. Don't do anything fancy.</p>
        <p>Create an executive summary of your data where you combine all the basic stats, artifacts, and sanity checks. Save it as a PDF.</p>
          <h3>Write down everything obviously interesting about your data</h3>
          <p>Interesting means not predictable, either via intuition or according to existing literature.</p>
        <p>If there's nothing obviously interesting (unlikely), either select a new dataset, or begin a model comparison approach.</p>
        <p>Data can be made interesting by comparing models against it. When two models are mutually exclusive yet both reasonable according to the literature, identifying which model captures the data better, or certain features of the data better, is interesting.</p>
        <h3>Quantify the interesting phenomena</h3>
          <p>Be simple.</p>
          <p>New questions may arise as the process continues. It is iterative</p>
          <p>Write about why your results are interesting. Explain why they were not predictable, or how they have created new evidence for ruling out certain models of your system.</p>

        <h3>Beware the twilight zone</h3>
          The twilight zone of data analysis is when one applies a complex "reduction" method to the data and tries to interpret the results. While this can sometimes be sound and powerful, it is also easy to mistake a feature of the data for a feature of the reduction method. For instance, quantities like "number of clusters" are often a consequence of a parameter in the clustering algorithm (e.g. specifying cluster size), rather than a reflection of the best guess "true" number of clusters in a dataset. The best way to verify results obtained in the twilight zone is to run the same methods on artificial datasets, one in which the same result is expected to appear and one where it is not. Such anchor points will give the results applied to your data much more meaning and soundness.

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p>
        <strong>Can I pay for your services using my NIH grant?</strong><br />
        Yes! Our services are covered under the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_7/7.9_allowability_of_costs_activities.htm#Professional_Services_Costs">Professional Services Costs section</a> of the NIH Grants Policy statement on Allowability of Costs/Activities. If you will need to move funds from other budget items to pay for our services please see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_8/8.1_changes_in_project_and_budget.htm">Changes in Project Budget</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>How does authorship work?</strong><br />
        By default we do not expect authorship on papers published by your research group. However, we are all scientists and if a natural collaboration should arise as a result of our contributions we would be happy to discuss the possibility of co-authorship.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Is this just going to take away projects from students and postdocs?</strong><br />
        No! Our goal is to help give researchers <em>more</em> time to think deeply about big questions.
        We achieve this by providing the opportunity to contract out routine data tasks so that you have more time to be creative and push the frontier.
        We do believe that it's important for trainees to understand the complexities and nuances of data processing and analysis, and therefore highly encourage young scientists to learn to implement these methods on their own.
        However, repeated, routine implementation of many common methods can take substantial time without necessarily providing substantial benefit to the investigator.
        Luckily, we're here to help!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Do you provide custom modeling/data analyses?</strong><br />
        Yes! If you're interested in a service not listed on our services page, just <a href="#">write us to inquire</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>How can I trust the results of your analyses?</strong><br />
        Trusting analysis results is a complex topic in the biological sciences that we have spent extensive time thinking about.
        Our main philosophy is to validate analyses not like software engineers but like scientists.
        This means that while we strive to write excellent code, we focus on sanity checks and scientific controls over mechanical application of commercial testing strategies, which can be highly involved yet miss fundamental scientific errors.
        One common approach we take, for instance, is to test analyses on artificial data, making it far easier to trust the results when applied to real datasets.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Do we get to see the code used for analyzing our data?</strong><br />
        Yes! We return all code and processed data to you.
        Please see our <a href="analysis_workflow.html">analysis workflow</a> for a comprehensive understanding of how we write reliable, interpretable code that can be easily reused and modified by others.
