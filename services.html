        <h1>Executive data report with code</h1>
        <p>
        A basic report on your data containing a collection of typical/atypical examples, summary of key artifacts, all the basic statistics, and miscellaneous comments about interesting phenomena. An executive report also increases your data's half-life, making it infinitely easier to onboard new researchers. We return all code used to make the report so that you can easily reproduce and extend it.

          <!-- This provides a fundamental ground for beginning more sophisticated analyses and is crucial to developing a mental model of your data.  -->
          <!-- It is also allows you to interact with your dataset with an LLM, which will be crucial for searching data for phenomena of interest.  -->

      <section class="service">
        <h1>Baseline model fitting</h1>
        <p>
        Fit baseline models to a dataset to create a crucial reference point for further analyses. Typical baseline models include linear/logistic regression, or simple neural networks.
