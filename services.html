<h1>Data services</h1>
    <h3>Investigator report</h3>
    The key starting point and our most recommended service for any serious endeavor to understand a new dataset. An investigator report is a single PDF describing the structure of the dataset, a collection of representative examples of individual samples or snapshots of the data, plots of all the basic statistics (e.g. histograms, tuning curves, timescale analysis, obvious correlations, basic dimensionality analyses, etc. for neural recordings), all the basic sanity checks, a brief summary of any obvious artifacts or unexpected features of the dataset. The report includes nothing state-of-the-art, but is a crucial foundation for more complex analyses, model fitting, and hypothesis testing.
    
    <br /><br />
    Taking the time to write a report about a new dataset is one of the most important things I've learned in over a decade of analyzing complex, multi-faceted datasets in neuroscience. While it can be tempting to skip this step and jump straight into fitting a sophisticated model to your data, but if your goal is to transform data into interesting and reproducible scientific results, writing a report about all the basics in your data will make your life immensely easier. This is because it builds provides crucial intuition about the data, identifies all the features an expert would reasonably notice in looking over the dataset, serves as a critical reference point for more sophisticated analyses.
    
    <br /><br />
    Along with the PDF of the report itself, this service will provide you with a version of your data that is easy to work with and code to reproduce all of the analyses in the report, and which can be easily built upon for more sophisticated analyses. (See our <a href="analysis_workflow.html">analysis workflow</a> for how we organize code to send back to you).

    Want to do it yourself? See our <a href="investigator_report_guide.html">guide</a>. But we also know you're busy so we're here to help!
    
    <h3>Analysis proposal</h3>
    Not entirely sure what analyses will help you answer your scientific question?
    Let us help make a plan.
    
    <h3>Data to NWB</h3>
    Convert your data to NWB format so it can be shared with the world.
    
    <h3>Behavior tracking</h3>
    Have a behavior dataset you want converted into tracked keypoint time-series? We're here to help!
    
    <h3>Catch a fly</h3>
    Test specific hypotheses or compare specific models against your data.

    <h3>Go fishing</h3>
    Is there clear interesting signal in your data but you're not quite sure what to make of it?
    This package applies data-driven techniques to identify hidden patterns in your data that may lend more insight than the basic stats.
    
    <h3>Custom services</h3>
    We also offer custom analysis and modeling services. See <a href="custom_services.html">here</a> for a list of what we currently offer and a form to tell us what you need.
    
<h1>Pricing</h1>
    Specific prices will depend on the dataset and analysis in question.
    A rough estimate is about $150/hour of focused work by a trained postdoctoral-level computational neuroscientist.
    In general, larger and more complicated (or disorganized) datasets will be more expensive.
    If pricing is an issue we also have options for a sliding scale, just contact us.
