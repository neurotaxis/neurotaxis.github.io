	<h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
        Our goal is to make it easier for great scientists to do their best work.
        One of the ways we achieve this is by providing high quality data services so that you have more time to think deeply about the biggest questions that matter most to you.
        We also develop open-access educational materials, such as our latest  <a href="analyzing_time_series.html">mini-course</a> on analyzing naturalistic time-series, so that whether you use our services or not, you can hit the ground running and get to the frontier of research fast.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our services</h2>
        <p>
        Modern neuroscience experiments routinely produce complex datasets that can be challenging to analyze, but we're here to help.
        We provide a range of packages and services, including writing basic data reports, running preliminary analyses for grant proposals, fitting baseline models to data, designing analysis plans, and more.
        A popular option is a comprehensive "Investigator Report" for a dataset in order to simplify and accelerate future analyses targeted at specific scientific questions.
        Check out a detailed list of some of the <a href="services.html">services we offer</a> to get more of a feel for what we do.
        We also provide review services for manuscripts and other scientific documents, as well as in-house analysis workshops.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our vision</h2>
        <p>
        By helping labs accelerate their work we hope to simultaneously create a new, self-funded space for cutting-edge science.
        We envision our future as a science "agency", in which data and modeling projects are routed from labs to trained computational neuroscientists as a means to fund independent research.
        Through this model we hope to provide our scientists with flexible, reliable funding by contributing their expertise to specific projects in other labs, together with space, community and resources to embark on open-ended, curiosity-driven research.
        If you have or are expecting a PhD in neuroscience or a related field and would be interested in working as a scientist through our company, <a href="#">please write us!</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Can I pay for your services using my NIH grant?</strong><br />
        Yes! Our services are covered under the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_7/7.9_allowability_of_costs_activities.htm#Professional_Services_Costs">Professional Services Costs section</a> of the NIH Grants Policy statement on Allowability of Costs/Activities. If you will need to move funds from other budget items to pay for our services please see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_8/8.1_changes_in_project_and_budget.htm">Changes in Project Budget</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>How does authorship work?</strong><br />
        By default we do not expect authorship on papers published by your research group. However, we are all scientists and if a natural collaboration should arise as a result of our contributions we would be happy to discuss the possibility of co-authorship.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Is this just going to take away projects from students and postdocs?</strong><br />
        No! Our goal is to help give researchers <em>more</em> time to think deeply about big questions.
        We achieve this by providing the opportunity to contract out routine data tasks so that you have more time to be creative and push the frontier.
        We do believe that it's important for trainees to understand the complexities and nuances of data processing and analysis, and therefore highly encourage young scientists to learn to implement these methods on their own.
        However, repeated, routine implementation of many common methods can take substantial time without necessarily providing substantial benefit to the investigator.
        Luckily, we're here to help!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Do you provide custom modeling/data analyses?</strong><br />
        Yes! If you're interested in a service not listed on our services page, just <a href="#">write us to inquire</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>How can I trust the results of your analyses?</strong><br />
        Trusting analysis results is a complex topic in the biological sciences that we have spent extensive time thinking about.
        Our main philosophy is to test our analyses not like software engineers but like scientists.
        This means that while we strive to write excellent code, we do not focus on unit/integration tests as the primary means for validating results.
        Instead we focus on sanity checks and scientific controls.
        One common approach we take, for instance, is to run identical analyses on artificial data where the ground truth is known, which makes it far easier to trust the results when applied to real datasets.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Do we get to see the code used for analyzing our data?</strong><br />
        Yes! We return all code and processed data to you.
        Please see our <a href="analysis_workflow.html">analysis workflow</a> for a comprehensive understanding of how we write reliable, interpretable code that can be easily reused and modified by others.

        <h2>About the founder</h2>
        <p>
        Rich Pang has over a decade of experience analyzing and modeling complex, naturalistic datasets in neuroscience.
        During his PhD at the University of Washington he analyzed and modeled insect flight and dopamine dynamics.
        During his postdoc at Princeton University he developed methods for leveraging natural behavior data to discover neural algorithms. He also has extensive experience in theoretical work, where he has spent significant time studying how activity dynamics and neuroplasticity can mediate working and episodic memory.
