	<h3>Our mission</h3>
        <p>
        Our goal is to make it easier for great scientists to do their best work.
        One of the ways we achieve this is by providing high quality data services so that you have more time to think deeply about the biggest questions that matter most to you.
        We also develop free, open-access educational materials so that whether you use our services or not, you can hit the ground running and get to the frontier of research fast.
        Check out our latest <a href="analyzing_time_series.html">mini-course</a> on analyzing time-series data in neuroscience.
        </p>
        <h3>Our services</h3>
        <p>
        Modern neuroscience is flooded with large-scale, complex datasets that can be very challenging to analyze.
        We provide a range of packages and services, from writing basic reports about datasets, to running preliminary analyses for your grant proposals, to designing comprehensive analysis plans to help you get the most insight possible from your data.
        One of our most popular options are to clean and characterize multiple datasets so that you know which ones are most worth pursuing further.
        Check out a detailed list of some of the <a href="services.html">services we offer</a> to get more of a feel for what we do.
        We also provide review services for manuscripts and other scientific documents, as well as in-house analysis workshops.
        </p>
        <h3>Our vision</h3>
        <p>
        In helping researchers world-wide accelerate their data analyses we plan to create a new, self-funded space for cutting-edge science.
        We envision our future as a science "agency", in which data and modeling projects are routed from labs to trained, expert computational neuroscientists.
        Through this model we hope to provide our scientists with flexible, reliable funding by contributing their expertise to specific projects in other labs, together with scientific community and resources so they can embark on open-ended high-risk research that will push the frontier of our field.
        If you have or are expecting a PhD in neuroscience or a related field and would be interested in working as a scientist through our company, <a href="#">please write us!</a>
        </p>
        <h3>About the founder</h3>
        <p>
        Rich Pang has over 10 years of experience analyzing complex data in neuroscience.
        During his PhD at the University of Washington he analyzed and modeled insect flight trajectories tracking odor plumes as well as multi-dimensiona, time-varying dopamine signals in fruit flies.
        During his postdoc at Princeton University he developed methods for leveraging natural behavior time-series to discover novel bioplausible neural algorithms. He also has extensive experience in theoretical work, where he has spent significant time studying how activity dynamics and neuroplasticity can mediate working and episodic memory.

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Can I pay for your services using my NIH grant?</strong>
        Yes! Our services are covered under the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_7/7.9_allowability_of_costs_activities.htm#Professional_Services_Costs">Professional Services Costs section</a> of the NIH Grants Policy statement on Allowability of Costs/Activities. If you will need to move funds from other budget items to pay for our services please see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_8/8.1_changes_in_project_and_budget.htm">Changes in Project Budget</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>How does authorship work?</strong>
        By default we do not expect authorship on papers published by your research group. However, we are all scientists and if a natural collaboration should arise as a result of our contributions we would be happy to discuss the possibility of co-authorship.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Is this just going to take away projects from students and postdocs?</strong>
        No! Our goal is to help give researchers more time to think deeply about big questions.
        We achieve this by providing the opportunity to contract out routine data tasks so that you have more time to be creative and push the frontier.
        We do believe that it's important for trainees to understand the complexities and nuances of data processing and analysis, and therefore highly encourage young scientists to learn to implement these methods on their own.
        However, repeated, routine implementation of many common methods can take substantial time without necessarily providing substantial benefit to the investigator.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Do you provide custom modeling/data analyses?</strong>
        Yes! If you're interested in a service not listed on our services page, just <a href="#">write us to inquire</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>How can I trust the results of your analyses?</strong>
        Trusting analysis results is a complex topic in the biological sciences that we have spent extensive time thinking about.
        Our main philosophy is to test our analyses not like software engineers but like scientists.
        This means that while we strive to write excellent code, we do not focus on unit/integration tests as the primary means for validating results.
        Instead we focus on sanity checks and scientific controls.
        One common approach we take, for instance, is to run identical analyses on artificial data where the ground truth is known, which makes it far easier to trust the results when applied to real datasets.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Do we get to see the code used for analyzing our data?</strong>
        Yes! We return all code and processed data to you.
        Please see our <a href="#">data analysis workflow philosophy</a> for a comprehensive understanding of how we write reliable, interpretable code that can be easily reused and modified by others.
