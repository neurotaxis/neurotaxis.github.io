        Rich Pang has over a decade of experience analyzing and modeling complex, naturalistic datasets in neuroscience.
        During his PhD at the University of Washington he analyzed and modeled insect flight and dopamine dynamics.
        During his postdoc at Princeton University he developed methods for leveraging natural behavior data to discover neural algorithms. He also has extensive experience in theoretical work, where he has spent significant time studying how activity dynamics and neuroplasticity can mediate working and episodic memory.
