              <p>Data is the bread and butter of science, but modern datasets and analysis routines can be quite complex. It's not uncommon to spend years trying to make sense of things. We provide support/consulting services to help you simplify this process, as well as online educational resources to help teach you everything we know along the way.</p>

        <a href="https://rkp.science"><strong>Rich Pang</strong></a> has over a decade of experience working with complex, naturalistic datasets in neuroscience.
        During his PhD at the University of Washington he analyzed and modeled insect flight and dopamine dynamics.
        During his postdoc at Princeton University he developed methods for extracting neural algorithms from natural behavior and network models of memory and learning. 
        He also served as a TA for Coursera's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/">Computational Neuroscience course.</a>
        His current research interests include plasticity and learning, spiking networks, and latent variable modeling.

          <div class="sidekick-content">
        <p>Our goal is to help great scientists do their best work. We aim to achieve this by providing expert services and educational resources to the scientific community at large while also creating space for original research free from traditional funding constraints. Our ultimate vision is to push the frontier by creating new, self-funded spaces for curiosity-driven research.</p>
