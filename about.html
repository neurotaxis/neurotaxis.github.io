          <div class="sidekick-content">
              <p>Data is the bread and butter of science, but modern datasets and analysis routines can be complex. It's easy to spend years running in circles trying to make sense of things.</p>
              
              <p>At Neurotaxis (derived from the root "taxis", the biological term for directed movement) we help you simplify this process while teaching you everything we know along the way. This way you get great results fast while cultivating an expert team that can transform data into science skillfully.</p>

        <a href="https://rkp.science"><strong>Rich Pang</strong></a> has over a decade of experience working with complex, naturalistic datasets in neuroscience.
        During his PhD at the University of Washington he analyzed and modeled insect flight and dopamine dynamics.
        During his postdoc at Princeton University he developed methods for extracting neural algorithms from natural behavior and network models for the neural basis of memory and learning. 
        Ongoing research interests include episodic learning and memory, latent variable models, and spiking networks.<br />

          <div class="sidekick-content">
        <p>Our goal is to help great scientists do their best work. We aim to achieve this by providing expert services to the scientific community at large while creating space for the pursuit of original research ideas free from traditional funding constraints. Our ultimate vision is to push the frontier by creating new, self-funded spaces for curiosity-driven research.</p>
