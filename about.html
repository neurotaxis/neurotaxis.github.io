        Data is the bread and butter of science, but it can be extraordinarily complex. It's easy to spend years running in circles trying to make sense of it. We help you simplify this process while teaching you everything we know along the way. This way you get great results fast while cultivating an expert team that knows how to turn data into science skillfully.

        <a href="https://rkp.science"><strong>Rich Pang</strong></a> has over a decade of experience working with complex, naturalistic datasets in neuroscience.
        During his PhD at the University of Washington he analyzed and modeled insect flight and dopamine dynamics.
        During his postdoc at Princeton University he developed methods for leveraging natural behavior data to discover neural algorithms, as well as mathematical theories for the neural basis of memory.<br />

        <p>Our goal is to help great scientists do their best work. To do so, we believe in creating sustainable, self-funded spaces for doing basic science research. At Neurotaxis we provide expert services to the scientific community at large while simultaneously giving our scientists ample space to pursue original research ideas free from traditional funding constraints.</p>
